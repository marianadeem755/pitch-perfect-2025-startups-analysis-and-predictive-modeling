# Pitch Perfect 2025 Startups Comprehensive Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Description
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to analyze the Data and do model Training, evaluation and predicting trends in startups for the year 2025. It provides insights into the dataset structure, performs data preprocessing, and applies predictive modeling techniques to forecast outcomes.
## Dataset Information
- The dataset contains information about startups, including features such as funding, team size, market sector.
- The notebook begins by displaying the dataset's shape and structure to understand its composition.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pitch-perfect-2025-startups-predictive-modeling
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pitch-perfect-2025-startups-predictive-modeling.ipynb
   ```

## What This Notebook Does
1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Displays the shape and structure of the dataset.
   - Provides an overview of the dataset's columns, data types, and missing values.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Encodes categorical variables and normalizes numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Several visualizations and statistical analyses were conducted to understand:
- The distribution of startups across different industries and funding stages.
- Correlation between features, particularly focusing on employee counts and funding amounts.
4. Modeling
## Model Performance
Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
> **Best Performing Model:** The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, precision, and recall scores. This model's ensemble approach allows it to effectively learn from the data and handle non-linear relationships better than simpler models.

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Builds machine learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict startup success in 2025.
   - Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix and classification report.

6. **Results and Insights**:
   - Summarizes the findings and provides insights for stakeholders.

## Outputs
- Key statistics and visualizations from the dataset.
- Predictive model performance metrics.
- Insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
